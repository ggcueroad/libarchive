.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies files between archives and directories.
This implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar,
rpm, 7-zip, lha, cab, mtree, and ISO 9660 cdrom images and can create tar,
pax, cpio, ar, zip, xar, 7-zip, ISO 9660, mtree, and shar archives.
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It <none>
.Em List mode.
List archive contents to stdout.
.It Fl r
.Em Read mode.
Extract to disk from stdin.
.It Fl w
.Em Write mode.
Write archive contents to stdout.
.It Fl r Fl w
.Em Copy mode.
Copy the file operands to the destination directory.
.El
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
Unless specifically stated otherwise, options are applicable in
all operating modes.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm @ Ns Pa archive
(Write mode only)
The specified archive is opened and the entries
in it will be appended to the current archive.
As a simple example,
.Dl Nm Fl w Pa newfile Cm @ Ns Pa original.tar
writes a new archive to standard output containing a file
.Pa newfile
and all of the entries from
.Pa original.tar .
In contrast,
.Dl Nm Fl w Pa newfile Pa original.tar
creates a new archive with only two entries.
Similarly,
.Dl Nm Fl wz Fl Fl format Cm pax Cm @ Ns Pa -
reads an archive from standard input (whose format will be determined
automatically) and converts it into a gzip-compressed
pax-format archive on stdout.
In this way,
.Nm
can be used to convert archives from one format to another.
.It Fl a
Append files to the end of an archive that was previously written.
.It Fl b Ar blocksize , Fl Fl block-size Ar blocksize
Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.
As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing
to tape drives, and usually not even then as the default block size of
20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.
.It Fl c , Fl Fl inverse
Do not process files or directories that match the
specified patterns.
.It Fl Fl compress , Fl Fl uncompress
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr compress 1 .
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.
Note that, unlike other
.Nm pax
implementations, this implementation recognizes compress compression
automatically when reading archives.
.It Fl D , Fl Fl keep-newer-ctime-files
(Read and Copy mode only)
Do not overwrite existing files unless files and directories are newer than.
This compares ctime entries before any pathname modifications.
.It Fl d , Fl Fl norecurse , Fl Fl no-recursion
(Write and Copy mode only)
Do not recursively archive the contents of directories.
.It Fl Fl disable-copyfile
Mac OS X specific.
Disable the use of
.Xr copyfile 3 .
.It Fl f Ar file , Fl Fl file Ar file
Read the archive from or write the archive to the specified file.
.It Fl G Ar [#]group
Select file entries based on its
.Pa group
name.
Multiple
.Fl G
options may be supplied. You can specify
.Pa group
id with # prefix.
.It Fl H
(Write and Copy mode only)
Symbolic links named on the command line will be followed; the
target of the link will be archived, not the link itself.
.It Fl Fl help
Show usage.
.It Fl Fl insecure
Preserve pathnames.
By default, absolute pathnames (those that begin with a /
character) have the leading slash removed both when creating archives
and extracting from them.
Also,
.Nm
will refuse to extract archive entries whose pathnames contain
.Pa ..
or whose target directory would be altered by a symlink.
This option suppresses these behaviors.
.It Fl i , Fl Fl confirmation , Fl Fl interactive
(r, w, rw modes only)
Rename files interactively.
For each file, a prompt is written to
.Pa /dev/tty
containing the name of the file and a line is read from
.Pa /dev/tty .
If the line read is blank, the file is skipped.
If the line contains a single period, the file is processed normally.
Otherwise, the line is taken to be the new name of the file.
.It Fl J , Fl Fl xz
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr xz 1 .
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.
Note that, unlike other
.Nm pax
implementations, this implementation recognizes XZ compression
automatically when reading archives.
.It Fl j , Fl Fl bzip , Fl Fl bzip2 , Fl Fl bunzip2
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr bzip2 1 .
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.
Note that, unlike other
.Nm pax
implementations, this implementation recognizes bzip2 compression
automatically when reading archives.
.It Fl k , Fl Fl keep-old-files
(Read and Copy mode only)
Do not overwrite existing files.
In particular, if a file appears more than once in an archive,
later copies will not overwrite earlier copies.
.It Fl L , Fl Fl dereference
(Write and Copy mode only)
All symbolic links will be followed.
Normally, symbolic links are archived as such.
With this option, the target of the link will be archived instead.
.It Fl l , Fl Fl link
(Copy mode only)
Create links from the target directory to the original files,
instead of copying.
.It Fl Fl lrzip
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr lrzip 1 .
.It Fl Fl lzma
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with the original LZMA algorithm.
Use of this option is discouraged and new archives should be created with
.Fl Fl xz
instead.
Note that, unlike other
.Nm pax
implementations, this implementation recognizes LZMA compression
automatically when reading archives.
.It Fl Fl lzop
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr lzop 1 .
.It Fl n , Fl Fl fast-read
(Read and List mode only)
Extract or list only the first archive entry that matches each pattern
or filename operand.
Exit as soon as each specified pattern or filename has been matched.
By default, the archive is always read to the very end, since
there can be multiple entries with the same name and, by convention,
later entries overwrite earlier entries.
This option is provided as a performance optimization.
.It Fl Fl nodump
(Write and Copy modes only)
Honor the nodump file flag by skipping this file.
.It Fl Fl null
Filenames or patterns are separated by null characters,
not by newlines.
This is often used to read filenames output by the
.Fl print0
option to
.Xr find 1 .
.It Fl o Ar options , Fl Fl options Ar options
Select optional behaviors for particular modules.
The argument is a text string containing comma-separated
keywords and values.
These are passed to the modules that handle particular
formats to control how those formats will behave.
Each option has one of the following forms:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Ar key=value
The key will be set to the specified value in every module that supports it.
Modules that do not support this key will ignore it.
.It Ar key
The key will be enabled in every module that supports it.
This is equivalent to
.Ar key Ns Cm =1 .
.It Ar !key
The key will be disabled in every module that supports it.
.It Ar module:key=value , Ar module:key , Ar module:!key
As above, but the corresponding key and value will be provided
only to modules whose name matches
.Ar module .
.El
The currently supported modules and keys are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Cm iso9660:joliet
Support Joliet extensions.
This is enabled by default, use
.Cm !joliet
or
.Cm iso9660:!joliet
to disable.
.It Cm iso9660:rockridge
Support Rock Ridge extensions.
This is enabled by default, use
.Cm !rockridge
or
.Cm iso9660:!rockridge
to disable.
.It Cm gzip:compression-level
A decimal integer from 0 to 9 specifying the gzip compression level.
.It Cm xz:compression-level
A decimal integer from 0 to 9 specifying the xz compression level.
.It Cm mtree: Ns Ar keyword
The mtree writer module allows you to specify which mtree keywords
will be included in the output.
Supported keywords include:
.Cm cksum , Cm device , Cm flags , Cm gid , Cm gname , Cm indent ,
.Cm link , Cm md5 , Cm mode , Cm nlink , Cm rmd160 , Cm sha1 , Cm sha256 ,
.Cm sha384 , Cm sha512 , Cm size , Cm time , Cm uid , Cm uname .
The default is equivalent to:
.Dq device, flags, gid, gname, link, mode, nlink, size, time, type, uid, uname .
.It Cm mtree:all
Enables all of the above keywords.
You can also use
.Cm mtree:!all
to disable all keywords.
.It Cm mtree:use-set
Enable generation of
.Cm /set
lines in the output.
.It Cm mtree:indent
Produce human-readable output by indenting options and splitting lines
to fit into 80 columns.
.It Cm zip:compression Ns = Ns Ar type
Use
.Ar type
as compression method.
Supported values are store (uncompressed) and deflate (gzip algorithm).
.El
The currently supported keys in
.Nm pax
are:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Cm listopt Ns = Ns Ar format
(List mode only)
Specify the output format of archive contents.
You can specified flags that can be used in
.Xr printf 1 .
Following flags can be also specified:
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Cm \&%T
The contents of its times is printed in the
.Xr strftime 3
style
.Sq \&%b \&%e \&%H:\&%M \&%Y .
This uses
.Cm mtime
by default but you can specify
.Em keyword ,
.Cm ctime
or
.Cm atime,
in the style, for example,
.Sq \&%(atime)T .
And also you can specify
.Fa subformat
as date format(see
.Xr strftime 3 )
in the style
.Sq \&%( Ns Em keyword Ns = Ns Em subformat Ns )T .
.It Cm \&%D
The contents of its device number is printed in the style
.Sq \&%lu.\&%lu .
.It Cm \&%M
The contents of its mode is printed in the style like
.Sq ls -l .
.It Cm \&%F
The contents of its pathname is printed.
.It Cm \&%L
The contents of its pathname and its linkname is printed in the style 
.Sq \&%s -> \&%s .
.El
Supported keywords include:
.Cm pathname , Cm linkname , Cm linkpath , Cm name,
.Cm atime , Cm ctime , Cm mtime, Cm mode , Cm dev , Cm devmajor , Cm devminor ,
.Cm gid , Cm gname , Cm uid , Cm uname , Cm size , Cm filesize ,
.Cm ino , Cm nlink , Cm rdev , Cm rdevmajor , Cm rdevminor .
It is likely some archive format does not support all those keywords.
.It Ns Ar keyword Ns = Ns Ar value
Overwrite archive contents by
.Ar value .
Supported keywords include:
.Cm atime , Cm ctime , Cm mtime, Cm mode , Cm gid , Cm gname , Cm uid , Cm uname .
.El
If a provided option is not supported by any module, that
is a fatal error.
.It Fl P
(Write and Copy mode only)
Do not follow symbolic links. This is the default mode. 
.It Fl p Ar string
(Read and Copy mode only)
.Bl -tag -compact -width indent
.It Cm a
Do not preserve atime.
.It Cm e
xxx.
.It Cm m
Do not preserve mtime.
.It Cm o
Preserve uid and gid.
.It Cm p
xxx.
.El
(Need more description.)
.It Fl s Ar pattern
Modify file or archive member names according to
.Pa pattern .
The pattern has the format
.Ar /old/new/ Ns Op ghHprRsS
where
.Ar old
is a basic regular expression,
.Ar new
is the replacement string of the matched part,
and the optional trailing letters modify
how the replacement is handled.
If
.Ar old
is not matched, the pattern is skipped.
Within
.Ar new ,
~ is substituted with the match, \e1 to \e9 with the content of
the corresponding captured group.
The optional trailing g specifies that matching should continue
after the matched part and stopped on the first unmatched pattern.
The optional trailing s specifies that the pattern applies to the value
of symbolic links.
The optional trailing p specifies that after a successful substitution
the original path name and the new path name should be printed to
standard error.
Optional trailing H, R, or S characters suppress substitutions
for hardlink targets, regular filenames, or symlink targets,
respectively.
Optional trailing h, r, or s characters enable substitutions
for hardlink targets, regular filenames, or symlink targets,
respectively.
The default is
.Ar hrs
which applies substitutions to all names.
In particular, it is never necessary to specify h, r, or s.
.It Fl Fl strip-components Ar count
Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped.
Note that the pathname is edited after checking inclusion/exclusion patterns
but before security checks.
.It Fl T Ar [from_date] Ar [,to_date] Ar [/[c][m]]
(Need more description.)
.It Fl U Ar [#]user
Select file entries based on its
.Pa user
name.
Multiple
.Fl U
options may be supplied. You can specify
.Pa user
id with # prefix.
.It Fl u , Fl Fl keep-newer-mtime-files
Do not overwrite existing files unless files and directories are newer than.
This compares ctime entries before any pathname modifications.
.It Fl Fl use-compress-program Ar program
Pipe the input (in Read mode) or the output (in Write mode) through
.Pa program
instead of using the builtin compression support.
.It Fl v , Fl Fl verbose
Produce verbose output.
In create and extract modes,
.Nm
will list each file name as it is read from or written to
the archive.
In list mode,
.Nm
will produce output similar to that of
.Xr ls 1 .
Additional
.Fl v
options will provide additional detail.
.It Fl Fl version
Print version of
.Nm
and
.Nm libarchive ,
and exit.
.It Fl X , Fl Fl one-file-system
(Write and Copy mode only)
Do not cross mount points.
.It Fl x Ar format , Fl Fl format Ar format
(Write mode only)
Use the specified format for the created archive.
Supported formats include
.Dq cpio ,
.Dq pax ,
.Dq shar ,
and
.Dq ustar .
Other formats may also be supported; see
.Xr libarchive-formats 5
for more information about currently-supported formats.
In r and u modes, when extending an existing archive, the format specified
here must be compatible with the format of the existing archive on disk.
.It Fl Y , Fl Fl keep-newer-ctime-files2
(Read and Copy mode only)
Like
.Fl Fl keep-newer-ctime-files
, except this is checked after all the pathname modifications have completed.
.It Fl Z , Fl Fl keep-newer-mtime-files2
Like
.Fl Fl keep-newer-mtime-files
, except this is checked after all the pathname modifications have completed.
.It Fl z , Fl Fl gunzip , Fl Fl gzip
(Write mode only)
Compress the resulting archive with
.Xr gzip 1 .
In extract or list modes, this option is ignored.
Note that, unlike other
.Nm pax
implementations, this implementation recognizes gzip compression
automatically when reading archives.
